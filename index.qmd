::: {#hero-heading}
I am a [post-doc researcher](https://www.dpss.unipd.it/filippo-gambarota) at the University of Padova, Department of Developmental Psychology and Socialization.

My research concern **meta-analysis**, **data simulation** for power and design analysis and **multiverse analysis**. I am part of the [Psicostat](https://psicostat.dpss.psy.unipd.it/) research group.

In my free time I love coding and I am a speaker coach for [TEDx Padova](https://tedxpadova.org/team/).
