# Intro

The paper by Viechtbauer ([2005](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3102/10769986030003261)) provide a clear way to simulate standardized (SMD) and unstandardized (UMD) effect sizes for simulation studies.

# Unstandardized effect sizes

We define two independent groups as:

$$
X^C_{ij} \sim N(\mu^C_i, \sigma^2_i) \\
X^E_{ij} \sim N(\mu^E_i, \sigma^2_i)
$$

and the UMD as:

$$
ES_i = \mu^E_i - \mu^C_i
$$

With sampling variance:

$$
\sigma^2_{\epsilon_i} = s^2_i\left(\frac{1}{n^E_i} + \frac{1}{n^C_i}\right)
$$

Where $s^2_i$ is the typical pooled within-group variance.

In this case we simulate participant-level data:

```{r}
ES <- 0.3
s <- 1
n_E <- 30
n_C <- 30
k <- 30

di <- rnorm(k, ES, s * (1/n_E + 1/n_C))
```
